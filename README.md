# MASQ Node Browser-GUI
Browser Based MASQ GUI based on the MASQNodeUI-v2 interface 

This was created by the team of volunteers at MASQ Project

To successfully run this GUI, you must right initialize the MASQ daemon.

The easiest way to download this at the moment is to take the most recent build from our masq-results repo - this can be found here:

The downloaded tar file contains all files under the 'generated' folder

Run an elevated Command Prompt on your machine, navigate the the folder where you extracted the files and run the initialization command:

Windows
Mac
Linux
